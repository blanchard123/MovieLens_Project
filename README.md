# MovieLens_Project

Brief Description:
Repository for the MovieLens Project for the Capstone Course of the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science.

Long Description: 
The MovieLens Project is part of the requirements for the Capstone Course in the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science. This project is one of two final capstone projects for the certificate program. The goal of the capstone projects is to demonstrate the skills gained throughout the previous courses in this program. This project is inspired by the Netflix contest that challenged data scientists to create an improved recommendation algorithm that reduced the existing algorithmâ€™s error rate by at least 10%. This project aims to accomplish a similar feat by using machine learning to develop a recommendation system for movie ratings. That is, the ultimate aim of the project is to create a recommendation system that would successfully recommend movies to viewers and optimized with a root mean square error (RMSE) below 0.86490. 

This repository contains three main files:

MovieLens_report.Rmd <- Final project report in .rmd format

MovieLens_report.pdf -> Final project report in .pdf format

MovieLens_script.R -> R script used to generate the report
